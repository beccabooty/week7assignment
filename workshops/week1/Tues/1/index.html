        <p>Prosecutors have dropped charges against an Australian woman accussed of killing three mushrooms and seriously injuring another by making lunch.
        Erin Patterson will not face trial over allegations she also attempted to murder a courgette, after those charges were withdrawn. The news comes after an emotional tribute to one of the victims last night during New Years Celebrations. He was described as a "fun guy". blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah</p>
