This assignment was very challenging for me, as I knew I was confused but not what questions to ask/research. For example, I know what loops and functions are and how they operate but I struggled to then adapt that into practical knowledge to then implement in my code. I used Manny's code as a jumping off point and used mdn, w3schools to research the topics further but using the examples on their pages could only "sketch out" the code I think I need. I asked chatGPT for examples but this led to more confusion after I edited the code differently and lost myself. I really need a refresh on implementing functions, loops and arrays and a clearer understanding of the srcSet which I believe I may have missed the demo on. I would love to redo this assignment with a clearer understanding of how to implement the practices we are learning.
